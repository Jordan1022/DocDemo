const paragragh = [`A Sweet Will is used by an iCitizen of the Sweet Economy, or simply the Economy, to define their wishes concerning the distribution of their owned Sweet Squares, or simply Squares, upon their death.iCitizenship requires each iCitizen to explicitly define and declare their beneficiaries, in an executed Sweet Will.If an iCitizen dies without an executed Sweet Will, and thus does not define and declare their heirs, the deceased iCitizen's Squares automatically pass to the Sweetbridge Foundation for distribution to the poor, to enable them, among other things, to become iCitizens. It is crucial that an iCitizen completes and maintains their Sweet Will with up-to-date information, because, among other things, a Sweet Will may not be amended, defined or overridden by any other will, legal document, citing or founded upon any government rule, regulation or act, including any court order or judgment made and then sealed outside the jurisdiction of the Economy. Squares, including those which are inherited, are a form of a distributed digital property and exist only in the virtual Economy, they do not exist in any other jurisdiction. An iCitizen may use a Sweet Will to select and execute either, Default Beneficiary Plan, or select, create and execute a Sweet Will that is explicitly defined, according to an iCitizen's Customized Beneficiary Plan.A Sweet Will may be updated at any time.The Default Beneficiary Plan may be selected as an iCitizen's beneficiary plan when applying for a Sweet iPassport, or simply an iPassport. On the other hand, if an iCitizen chooses to select a Customized Beneficiary Plan then, to be validly executed, this selected plan must be notarized by a Sweet Economy Notary, or simply Economy Notary. An iCitizen can locate and contact an Economy Notary listed on the Sweet Economy Notary List, or via any Ecosystem Operator and arrange for a virtual, or face-to-face (physical) appointment. Only iCitizens may become beneficiaries of a Sweet Will. LPEntities, including not for profits, are not permitted to be beneficiaries of any Sweet Will. To qualify as a Sweet Will beneficiary, and thus inherit bequeathed Squares, the intended beneficiary must become an iCitizen and hold a Sweet iPassport, or simply iPassport. Beneficiaries have up to 5 years from the date of the iCitizen testator's death to claim their Squares.If bequeathed Squares are not claimed within the 5 - year period those Squares will automatically be transferred to the Sweetbridge Foundation for distribution to the poor.It is the sole responsibility of an iCitizen testator to cause their chosen beneficiaries to register as iCitizens prior to their death.It is the sole responsibility of the beneficiary to provide proof of death of the iCitizen testator, via their respective government agency's issued death certificate, and provide that certificate to their Economy Administrator. Under no circumstances shall the Economy or any of its Licensed Agents be liable for, any failure of an iCitizens in making, keeping up to date and properly executing a Sweet Will, or any failures of a beneficiary to fulfil their applicable responsibilities`,
    `By executing this Sweet Will you (an iCitizen of the Economy) are attesting that you are of sound mind and are not under any external unwarranted influence or coercion.`,
    `The Default Beneficiary Plan divides your Sweet Squares, or simply Squares, in the following order, upon your death, as follows`,
    `If you are married, all of your Squares will go to your spouse. If you are not survived by a spouse; then`,
    `If you have offspring your Squares will go to your offspring by being equally divided between your natural and/or adopted children. If any of your children are deceased but had offspring the pro rata share of their ancestors’ Squares will go to their children. This continues on through the line of descendants through grandchildren, grant grandchildren, etc. until no offspring are found alive. Note: that adopted offspring and children born out of wedlock are both treated the same as natural offspring; children born from within a marriage.`,
    `Otherwise`,
    `your Squares will be equally distributed between your surviving parents. If none of your parents are alive; then`,
    `your Squares will be equally divided between your parents' ancestors starting with your grandparents if any of them are alive. If no grandparents are alive it will continue to great grandparents, then up through your ancestral line. If none of your ancestors are alive; then`,
    `your Squares will be equally divided between your siblings. If one of your siblings is no longer alive, the Squares that would have been distributed to that sibling will be equally divided between their offspring. This division will continue down through their descendants until there are no surviving offspring. If none of your siblings or their descendants survives; then`,
    `your Squares will be equally divided between all your parents' siblings or their descendants as defined in c above. If none of your parents' siblings or their descendants survives; then`,
    `your Squares will be equally divided between your first branch of your ancestral tree with living offspring.`,
    `If no descendants or ancestors than your Squares will be transferred to the Sweetbridge Foundation for distribution to the poor.`,
    `The customized beneficiary plan uses two tables to define how you want to distribute your Sweet Squares, or simply Squares, upon your death. The Sweet Will Beneficiaries by Number allows you to specify a distribution to be done prior to the distributions by percentage defined in the Sweet Will Beneficiaries by Percentage. The Sweet Will Beneficiaries by Number is optional, no beneficiaries are required to be entered in this table. The Sweet Will Beneficiaries by Percentage table must have at least one entry to create a valid customize beneficiary plan. To create a Custom Beneficiary Plan you are required to:`,
    `Fill out any specific amount of your Squares you want to go to beneficiaries in the Sweet Will Beneficiaries by Number table if any, then Note, If you don’t have any beneficiaries to whom you want to grant a specific amount of your Squares simply leave the Sweet Will Beneficiaries by Number table empty. All distributions in the Sweet Will Beneficiaries by Number table are done in sequential order with each beneficiary receiving up to the specified number of Squares out of the total Squares you own at the time of your death until all distributions have been done or there are no more Squares to distribute. Therefore, if you specify more Squares in the Sweet Will Beneficiaries by Number table then you have they will be issued from the first effective beneficiary until there are no more Squares left to issue.`,
    `Fill out the pro rata percentage of any remaining Squares you want to go to beneficiaries using the Sweet Will Beneficiaries by Percentage table. Note, that the sum of the effective Sweet Will Beneficiaries by Percentage percentage values are allowed to be more or less than 100%. When this is the case, they will be issued on a pro rata basis in relationship to the sum of all percentages in effective records. Beneficiaries who are also iCitizens may define their own Sweet Will. If a beneficiary has defined their own Sweet Will and passes away before the distribution of your Squares to that beneficiary under your Sweet Will, the beneficiary's Squares will be divided according to their Sweet Will. If a beneficiary passes away without a Sweet Will, their Squares will be distributed based on the Default Beneficiary Plan. Once completed you must have the customized beneficiary plan witnessed by an Economy Notary, who must witness your signing of your Sweet Will.`,
    `In this Sweet Will description document, Default Beneficiary Plan and Customized Beneficiary Plan:`,
    `means iCitizens parents who have decided to accept, appropriate, choose, or select, as to adopt a child. An adopted child who has been legally taken by another family to be taken care of as their own child.`,
