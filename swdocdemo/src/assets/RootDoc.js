<h1 class="docTitle">Sweet Will</h1>
<div class="P">
          A #|Sweet Will|# is used by an #|iCitizen|# of
          the #|Sweet Economy|#, or simply the #|Economy|#,
          to define their wishes concerning the distribution of their #|owned|# #|Sweet Squares|#,
          or simply #|Squares|#, upon their death. #|iCitizenship|# requires
          each #|iCitizen|# to #|explicitly|# define and declare
          their beneficiaries, in an #|executed|# #|Sweet Will|#. If an #|iCitizen|# dies
          without an #|executed|# #|Sweet Will|#, and thus does not define and declare their heirs,
          the deceased #|iCitizen's|# #|Squares|# automatically pass to the #|Sweetbridge Foundation|# for
          distribution to the #|poor|#, to enable them, among other things, to become #|iCitizens|#.
</div>

        <div class="P">
          It is crucial that an #|iCitizen|# completes and maintains their #|Sweet Will|# with up-to-date
          information, because, among other things, a #|Sweet Will|# may not be amended, defined
          or overridden by any other will, legal document, citing or founded upon any #|government|# rule,
          regulation or act, including any court order or judgment made and then sealed
          outside the #|jurisdiction|# of the #|Economy|#. #|Squares|#, including
          those which are inherited, are a form of a distributed digital property and exist only in
          the virtual #|Economy|#, they do not exist in any other #|jurisdiction|#.
         </div>

         <div class="P">
          An #|iCitizen|# may use a #|Sweet Will|# to select and #|execute|# either, <a href="#defbenplan">Default Beneficiary Plan</a>,

          A #|Sweet Will|#  may be updated at any time.

          The <a href="#defbenplan">Default Beneficiary Plan</a> may be selected as an #|iCitizen's|# beneficiary plan when
          applying for a #|Sweet iPassport|#, or simply an #|iPassport|#. On the other hand, if an
         #|iCitizen|# chooses to select a <a href="">Customized Beneficiary Plan</a> then, to be validly #|executed|#,
          this selected plan must be notarized by a #|Sweet Economy Notary|#, or simply #|Economy Notary|#.
          An #|iCitizen|# can locate and contact an #|Economy Notary|# listed on the #|Sweet Economy Notary List|#,
          or via any #|Ecosystem Operator|# and arrange for a virtual, or face-to-face (physical) appointment.

          Only #|iCitizens|# may become beneficiaries of a #|Sweet Will|#.  #|LPEntities|#, including not for profits,
          are not permitted to be beneficiaries of any #|Sweet Will|#. To qualify as a #|Sweet Will|# beneficiary,
          and thus inherit bequeathed #|Squares|#, the intended beneficiary must become an #|iCitizen|# and hold
          a #|Sweet iPassport|#, or simply #|iPassport|#. Beneficiaries have up to 5 years from the
          date of the #|iCitizen|# #|testator's|# death to claim their #|Squares|#. If bequeathed #|Squares|# are not
          claimed within the 5-year period those #|Squares|# will automatically be transferred to

          beneficiary to provide proof of death of the #|iCitizen|# #|testator|#, via their
          respective #|government agency's|# issued death certificate, and provide that

          <ol>
            <li>If #|you|# are #|married|#, all of #|your|# #|Squares|# will go to #|your|# #|spouse|#. If #|you|# are not survived by a #|spouse|#; then</li>
            <li>If #|you|# have #|offspring|# #|your|# #|Squares|# will go to #|your|# #|offspring|# by being equally divided between #|your|# #|natural|# and/or #|adopted|# #|children|#. If any of #|your|# #|children|# are deceased but had #|offspring|# the pro rata share of their ancestors’ #|Squares|# will go to their #|children|#. This continues on through the line of descendants through grandchildren, grant grandchildren, etc. until no #|offspring|# are found alive.</li>
            Note: that #|adopted|# #|offspring|# and #|children|# born out of wedlock are both treated the same as #|natural|# #|offspring|#; #|children|# born from within a #|marriage|#.

        </div>
        <div>

        <h3 id="custombenplan">Customized Beneficiary Plan</h3>
          <div>The customized beneficiary plan uses two tables to define how #|you|# want to distribute #|your|# #|Sweet Squares|#, or simply #|Squares|#, upon your death. The #|Sweet Will|# Beneficiaries by Number allows #|you|# to specify a distribution to be done prior to the distributions by percentage defined in the #|Sweet Will|# Beneficiaries by Percentage.</div>
          <div>The #|Sweet Will|# Beneficiaries by Number is optional, no beneficiaries are required to be entered in this table. The #|Sweet Will|# Beneficiaries by Percentage table must have at least one entry to create a valid customize beneficiary plan.</div>
          <div>To create a <a href="#custombenplan">Custom Beneficiary Plan</a> #|you|# are required to:</div>
          <ol>
            <li>Fill out any specific amount of #|your|# #|Squares|# #|you|# want to go to beneficiaries in the #|Sweet Will|# Beneficiaries by Number table if any, then
            Note, If #|you|# don’t have any beneficiaries to whom #|you|# want to grant a specific amount of #|your|# Squares simply leave the #|Sweet Will|# Beneficiaries by Number table empty.
            All distributions in the #|Sweet Will|# Beneficiaries by Number table are done in sequential order with each beneficiary receiving up to the specified number of #|Squares|# out of the total #|Squares|# #|you|# #|own|# at the time of #|your|# death until all distributions have been done or there are no more #|Squares|# to distribute.
            Therefore, if #|you|# specify more #|Squares|# in the #|Sweet Will|# Beneficiaries by Number table then #|you|# have they will be issued from the first effective beneficiary until there are no more #|Squares|# left to issue.
            </li>
            <li>Fill out the pro rata percentage of any remaining #|Squares|# #|you|# want to go to beneficiaries using the #|Sweet Will|# Beneficiaries by Percentage table.
            Note, that the sum of the effective #|Sweet Will|# Beneficiaries by Percentage percentage values are allowed to be more or less than 100%. When this is the case, they will be issued on a pro rata basis in relationship to the sum of all percentages in effective records.
          </li>
          </ol>
            Beneficiaries who are also #|iCitizens|# may define their #|own|# #|Sweet Will|#. If a beneficiary has defined their #|own|# #|Sweet Will|# and passes away before the distribution of #|your|# #|Squares|# to that beneficiary under #|your|# #|Sweet Will|#, the beneficiary's #|Squares|# will be divided according to their #|Sweet Will|#. If a beneficiary passes away without a #|Sweet Will|#, their #|Squares|# will be distributed based on the <a href="#defbenplan">Default Beneficiary Plan</a>.
            Once completed #|you|# must have the customized beneficiary plan witnessed by an #|Economy Notary|#, who must witness #|your|# signing of #|your|# #|Sweet Will|#.
