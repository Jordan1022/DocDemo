//     { title: "Seed", text: "means a reward point, which, until redeemed, is the holder’s digital record of a right to a discount when buying goods or services from a participant in the Economy. Each reward point is equal to a discount worth of one unit of a designated form of cash, to be used in a future purchase. For simplicity, a participant's Seed is recorded using the same number of reward points as the discount value - which are units of the designated form of cash a participant has indicated they wish to use when buying goods and services in the Economy. Participants may convert the number of reward points to another unit of cash (for example, USD to GBP), to be redeemed with a future purchase, whenever they wish. For example, if a participant conducts most of their buying in USD they would indicate they want each Seed to be equivalent to the discounts worth in USD. Therefore, 10 of their Seed, redeemed for a USD purchase discount, would result in a $10 discount when redeemed with a purchase worth more than $10. The Sweet Commerce™ Rewards Program system automatically converts the Seed redeemed by the Buyer, to cash, for the Seller, when the Buyer completes a purchase by making payment. You may give Seed to anyone who is a participant within the Economy but the receipt receives Seed, not cash. Participants may not sell their Seed, Seed is simply a right to a discount provided as a reward for buying within the Economy, designed to encourage more buying." },
